        <p class="intro"> Hello, My name is <span id="name">____</span>. I am from <span id="city">____</span>,
            Nevada. I have lived here all my life, and I hope to get career opportunities outside of Reno.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include watching and playing sports, although it has been rough trying to keep up and play
            sports since I started school. My favorite sports team is the <span id="team">____</span>. I also enjoy
            playing video games. </p>
        <p>I currently work at <span id="work">____</span> as a driver and have been there for five years. I am looking forward to
            changing careers. I like new challenges.</p>
        <p>I also like hitting the gym, running, or trying out a new workout routine, and exercise can do wonders for the
            body and mind. It's great to push yourself, set goals, and enjoy the process of becoming stronger and more
            energized </p>
