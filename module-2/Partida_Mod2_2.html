        <p class="intro"> Hello, My name is Juan Partida. I am from Reno, Nevada. I have lived here all my life, and I hope to get career opportunities outside of Reno.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include watching and playing sports, although it has been rough trying to keep up and play sports since I started school. My favorite sports team is the Celtics. I also enjoy playing video games. </p>
        <p>I currently work at Waste Management as a driver and have been there for five years. I am looking forward to changing careers.  <span class="sentence">I like new challenges.</span> </p>
        <p>I also like hitting the gym, running, or trying out a new workout routine, and exercise can do wonders for the body and mind. It's great to push yourself, set goals, and enjoy the process of becoming stronger and more energized </p>
